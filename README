Description:
	Simple FileTransmitter for publication and download users
file resources in local network.
	This program is made as a standalone server that is not bound
to the IM-messendgers. It can serve several clients at once
(how powerful your computer or wide channel). Tree Shares transferred
to the client side as a single object, so remote users can choose
what they need, and get a selection from the server without prompting.
However, the client can not have other resources available on the server side.
Application use 34000-34100 (TCP) ports by default.
	For using SSL encripted connection you must to generate SSL Cerificate and Key.
	For using broadcast you must to open port 34001 (UDP).
	For use Avahi detection you must to open port 5353 (mDNS).

Description:
	This program is made as a standalone server that is not bound
to the IM-messendgers. It can serve several clients at once
(how powerful your computer or wide channel). Tree Shares transferred
to the client side as a single object, so remote users can choose
what they need, and get a selection from the server without prompting.
However, the client can not have other resources available on the server side.
	Simple FileTransmitter for publication and download users
file resources in local network. To use, you must open port 5353 (mDNS)
and 34000-34100 by default.
	For using SSL encripted connection you must generate SSL Cerificate and Key.
